# 253v Main Scholion 108

---

## The Big Question 

- In Scholia 108, why does the Scholion need to justify Hera’s specific request for an oath from Zeus, when Homer previously states that a nod of assent from the god is sufficient enough to ensure the truth of his promise?

---

## Context

- *Iliad* 19.108 
- Agamemnon, while addressing his men, claims that he is not responsible for the Hate (Ate) that made him claim Briseis. In this defense of his actions, he tells the story of how Hera tricked Zeus in the matter of Herakles birth, and scholion 108 appears in the midst of this story.

## Translation

Greek:

διὰ τί ἡ Ἥρα ὀμόσαι †πρὸς† τὸν Δία; ἢ δῆλον ὡς οὐ ποιοῦντα, ἃ ἂν φῇ. εἰ δὲ τοῦτο, διὰ τί οὐ κατανεῦσαι, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὀμόσαι ἠξίωσεν, ὡς καὶ ψευδομένου, ἂν μὴ ὀμόσῃ; ὁ δὲ ποιητής φησιν ἀληθεύειν „ὅ, τί κεν κεφαλῇ κατανεύσῃ“ (Α 527). τὸ μὲν οὖν ὅλον μυθῶδες· καὶ γὰρ οὐδ' ἀφ' ἑαυτοῦ ταῦτά φησιν Ὅμηρος οὐδὲ γινόμενα εἰσάγει, ἀλλ' ὡς διαδεδομένων περὶ τὴν Ἡρακλέους γένεσιν μέμνηται. ῥητέον δὲ ὅτι καὶ ὁ μῦθος εἰκότως εἰσάγει τὴν Ἥραν ὁρκοῦσαν τὸν Δία· πάντες γὰρ περὶ ὦν ἂν φοβῶνται, μὴ ἄλλως ἀποβῇ, πολὺ τῷ ἀσφαλεῖ προέχειν πειρῶνται· διὸ καὶ ἡ Ἥρα, ἅτε οὐ περὶ μικρῶν ἀγωνιζομένη καὶ τὸν Δία εἰδυῖα ὅτι αἰσθόμενος τὸν Ἡρακλέα δουλεύοντα ὑπεραγανακτήσει, τῇ ἰσχυροτάτῃ ἀνάγκῃ κατέλαβεν αὐτόν. οὕτως Ἀριστοτέλης

English:

But come now and swear an oath to me: Why does Hera make Zeus swear an oath? It is clear that he is not doing what she asks. If this is such, then why would he not nod an assent, but deem it worthy to swear an oath, in the belief he is lying, would he not be swearing an oath? The poet says that he (Zeus) speaks the truth ,”He nodded assent by his head” (A 527). This is therefore wholly mythological. For even Homer does not say this himself nor had he introduced it, but because he had been minded by the tradition about the birth of Herakles. Therefore it must be said that the story suitably introduces Hera making Zeus swear an oath. For everyone, with respect to the things they fear,  fear that things will end otherwise (in a bad way). Many attempt to attain safety. And Hera too, because she is not worrying about something small and she knows that Zeus will be exceedingly vexed once he realizes that Herakles is a slave, it is of the greatest necessity to seize this from him. Such says Aristotle.

### Inconsistancy 

- The wording of line 19.108, when Hera is asking Zeus for an oath, has strong inconsistancies to the passage when Zeus assures Thetis of the binding principles behind a god's nod of assent, lines [1.524-26][19.524] and [1.527][19.527]

## The Answer

![bookcover][Cover]

The Aristotele’s intent is to assure the readers that Homer is not being inconsistent here in this passage but that instead he is calling upon a larger tradition of these stories, that came before the concept of Homer himself, and aware enough of them to craft into his poetry.

## What is the Evidence Really Saying? 

![διαδεδομένων][tradition]


By explaining away Homer's inconsistencies by calling on a larger tradition of Greek cutlture and storytelling, this scholion is actually providing more evidence for the the theory that Homer was not a single poet. It supports the idea that there was a much larger historical and mythological convention happening in oral poetry, one that the audience would have been familiar with.

## Conclusions and Questions

- The multitext tradition is growing and continuing with this project as it has the last several centuries even before Homer adding to a multi-layered progression of information being passed on from story tellers before Homers to us?
- What does this mean for the research on oral tradition?
- If this multitext is the next step for the cycle of continuing with Homeric study, by hosting a digital venue to carry on the Homeric tradition, then what will the next step be after this in the future? The Greeks may have not had the tiniest inkling that their work could be projected into a virtual world, so how can we possible conceptualize the next step in this continuous cycle?
